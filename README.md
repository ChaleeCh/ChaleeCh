I'm passionate about **Data Science**, **Machine Learning**, **Artificial Intelligence**, **Data Engineering** and **Data Analytics**. Looking at the advancements in technology and science that have been happening in the last few decades, I'm interested in Learning and exploring how these fields will contribute further, to STEM as a whole. I love working with data, exploring and analyzing it and extracting valuable insights that can be used to improve businesses and the lives of people in general. I strongly believe Data has the potential to change the world and I'm so excited to be part of that change!

## About Me ðŸ‘€ðŸ˜… 

I'm a **BSc Pure and Applied Mathematics** student at the **Copperbelt University** in Kitwe, Zambia. I believe in life-long learning and have been studying Data Science for over a year now through Onecampus. I'm also enrolled in the Machine Learning track while also doing rigorous self learning and working on a number of personal projects which can be viewed on my portfolio at [Github Pages](https://chaleech.github.io/). Furthermore, I have completed courses in Python and Data Science from FreeCodeCamp, DataCamp and Analtytics Vidhya. Apart from that, I have completed training in applied Data Science by WorldQuant University. The training I recieved at OneCampus was especially crucial in my understanding of Data Science at a deeper level and growing my interest in Python, Machine Learning, the world of Data and tech in general. 
I am currently working as a **Data Science Associate Consultant** at [Prognoz.ai](http://prognozai.com/).
